## React Fetch Context

Since the authentication for Shopify and the standalone app are different, we need to be able to inject different fetch.
Our service uses this provider's fetch, and the application can inject the fetch it needs to use, depending injection.

### Component usage

```tsx
() => {
const customFetch = useAuth();
<FetchProvider fetch={customFetch}>
  // later when we can
  // const fetch = useFetch();
</FetchProvider>;
```
