## A React Hook to translation words

### Component usage

In this example we use the hook with scope set to bookings, and access all the nested translation when using the t method.

```js
import { useTranslation } from "./use-translation";

const { t } = useTranslation("bookings");

<h1>{t("all")}</h1>;
```
