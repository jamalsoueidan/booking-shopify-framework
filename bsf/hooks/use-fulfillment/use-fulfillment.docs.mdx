## A React Hook to increment a count

Increments the state of `count` by 1 each time `increment` is called

### Component usage

In this example clicking the button calls `increment` which increments the `count` by 1

```js
import { useFulfillment } from './use-fulfillment';

const { count, increment } = useFulfillment();

<h1>The count is {count}</h1>
<button onClick={increment}>increment</button>
```
