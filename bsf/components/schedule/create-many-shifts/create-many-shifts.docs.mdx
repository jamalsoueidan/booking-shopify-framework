description: A CreateManyShifts component.
---

This component creates array of shifts and has a onSubmit handler that sends an event when the form is submitted successfully.
You must handle submit via ref because this component can be used in both modal and other pages that need to put the submit button in different places on the page (see example).

```json
[
  {
    "start": "2023-01-23T08:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2023-01-23T15:00:00.000Z",
    "tag": "#4b6043"
  },
  {
    "start": "2023-01-30T08:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2023-01-30T15:00:00.000Z",
    "tag": "#4b6043"
  }
]
```

### Component usage

```js
const ref = useRef < CreateManyShiftsRefMethod > null;
const onSubmit = useCallback((fieldValues): CreateManyShiftsSubmitResult => {
  return {
    status: "success",
  };
}, []);

const submit = useCallback(() => {
  ref?.current?.submit();
}, [ref]);

return (
  <Card sectioned primaryFooterAction={{ content: "Submit", onAction: submit }}>
    <CreateManyShifts selectedDate={new Date()} onSubmit={onSubmit} ref={ref} />
  </Card>
);
```
