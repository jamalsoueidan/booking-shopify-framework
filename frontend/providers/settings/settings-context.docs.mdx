## React Theme Context

The setting provider is an essential component that must be present in order to enable the sharing of global settings across all levels of your application's.
Additionally, it adds nested instances of i18nProvider and AppProvider.
If this Provider is not a wrapper for the entire application, then you will not be able to use the components that are provided in BSF.

### Component usage

```tsx
() => {
  // user settings from backend
  const { data } = useUserSetting();

  return (
    <SettingsProvider
      value={{
        language: data?.language || "da",
        timeZone: data?.timeZone || "Europe/Copenhagen",
        features: {
          newShop: true
        }
      }}
    >
      <BrowserRouter>
        ....
      </BrowserRouter>
    </SettingsProvider>
  );
```
