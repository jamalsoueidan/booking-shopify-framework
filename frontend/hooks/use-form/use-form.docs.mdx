## A React Hook to handle forms

Use this hook when you need to handle forms

### Component usage

In this example we create field for fullname without any validation.

```js
const { fields } = useForm({
  fields: {
    fullname: useField({
      value: "",
      validates: [],
    }),
  },
});

return <TextField label="Fullname" autoComplete="" {...fields?.fullname} />;
```
